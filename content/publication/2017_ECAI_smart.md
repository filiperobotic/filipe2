abstract = "t  is  increasing  the  needof  improve  the existent  sources,   and  find greenerways  to  generate electrical  energy.  Besides,there  is  the  necessity  of  avoid the  energy  wasting  by  using  the  available  power  in  amore  efficient  way.  With  a  proper  data  preprocessing, the  multi-objective  search  and  optimization  algorithms have     been     used     as     potential     appliance     usage recommender  techniques  in  order  to energy  savings. The   proposal   of   this   work   is   anappliance   context recommendation  system  using  a  binary  multi  objective particle swarm optimization technique capable of, based on  a  given  context,  recommend  new  contexts  which would  spend  less  power  than  the  current, byminimally affectingthe userâ€™scomfort. The energy savings, for the first   analyzed   context recommendations,   were:   S1: 2,05%,  S2:  8,27%,  and  S3:  1%.  And  for  the  secondcontext, were: S1: 5,76%, S2: 0,5%, S3: 2,71%, and S4: 4,82%.   The   developed   technique   was   able   to   find solutions that spend less power and are more invasive to the  user  normal  behavior,as well assolutions that have less  power  economywith  a  minor  intervention  to  the user  normal  behavior.  This  technique  makes  sense  in  a Smart  Home  management  system  which  is  still  being developed."
